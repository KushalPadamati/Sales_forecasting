## Step1: Business Problem Understanding
# Identifying the relation between sales and advertisements
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Step2: Data Understanding
# 2.1 Data Collection
df=pd.read_csv("Advertising.csv")
df.head()

df.info()

#If someone was to spend a total of $200,000, what would the expected sales be?
# we have simplified this quite a bit by combining all the features into "total spend"
df['total_spend']=df['TV']+df['radio']+df['newspaper']
df.head()

## Step3: Data Preprocessing
#3.1 EDA
#On the basis of this data, how should you spend advertising money in the future?
1. Is there a relationship between ads and sales?
2. How strong is that relationship
3. Given Add's spending, can sales be predicted?

df.describe()

sns.pairplot(df)
plt.show()

df.corr()

#3.2 Data Cleaning
df.isnull().sum()

#3.3 Data Wangling
 #no encoding requied

#3.4 Train-Test Split
X= df.drop(columns='sales')
y= df['sales']

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.3,random_state=42)
